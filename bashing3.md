# Better Branching in Bash

## by Libor Spacek (liborty@github.com)

## Introduction

I love Bash really but it is a love-hate relationship. Take those `if` statements, for example. Forget to put a semicolon  **before** `then` and you are in deep trouble (?!?!). It would be a pity if this puts people off shell programming.

Fortunately, there is a much better way of branching on boolean tests, as exemplified in some of my code in my github encryption project ([1]).
