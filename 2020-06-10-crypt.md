## Encryption and Compression

##### by Liborty Rustafarian

### Introduction

You might think that encryption and compression are two different subjects  and you would be right. Nonetheless, there are certain  advantages to implementing them together, in a single package.

One of the simplest and at the same time most secure forms of encryption is bitwise XOR operation against a long symmetric key. With this method, the symmetry is perfect, meaning that exactly the same operation with the same key decrypts the encrypted text back to the original. 

It is easy to even set up group super security. Imagine a committee working on some super secret dossier. Normally, any member can leak it. However, if every member cumulatively encrypts it with his own secret key and all the intermediate copies are deleted, then there is no way for any subset of the group to leak the original document. It can not be read by anyone until all the members come back  together, presumably at their next  meeting, and decrypt it, in any order, with all of their original keys. The same can be done with the public asymmetric keys but XOR is much simpler (each member needs only one key) and quicker. We should thrive not to complicate things too much.   
  
Furthermore, as long as you make the key random and of the same size 
  
Granted, relatively short public and private keys for asymmetric  encryption do have certain practical advantages. Most of all the ease of disseminating the public keys over the internet. A cynic might add: also the chances of cracking short private keys.
